## Development
To get started you must have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed (latest LTS version is recommended) and then simply clone this repository and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

### Structure
ATLauncher NEXT uses webpack to compile ES2015 syntax to something that can be read and used by Electron. There are a total of 5 webpack configuration files:

 - webpack.config.base.js - this is the base webpack config of which all others will use. All the configs in this file will act as defaults and used in all other configs
 - webpack.config.development.js - this is the development config used when developing ATLauncher NEXT
 - webpack.config.electron.js - this is the Electron config which is used to compile the **main.production.js** file which is used by Electron as the main file it runs on start
 - webpack.config.node.js - this is the NodeJS config for running the hot reloading server for when you're developing
 - webpack.config.production.js - this is the production config which is used to compile the main application in the **app/** directory into a bundle for use within the Electron app
 
In order to run the Electron application 2 things need to be compiled by webpack into bundles which are stored (and gitignored) in the **app/** directory:

 - app/main.js - this is the main javascript file which Electron runs. It's build with `npm run build-main` and is built from the **main.production.js** file
 - app/bundle.js - this is the main applications javascript file which is included with script tags in the **app/app.html** file which Electron main.js file will load in the window. It's built with
                   `npm run build-app` and is built using the **app/index.js** entrypoint

### Running development version
When you want to start development of ATLauncher-NEXT then you simply need to run `npm run dev` which will start the servers needed to get hot reloading working and then start up Electron.

As you edit the application files, the Electron window will hot reload with the changes you made.

### Testing
TBD

### Building
To build this project for distribution simply run `npm run dist` which will create the packages for all the different systems in the **dist/** directory.
